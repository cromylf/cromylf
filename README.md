- 👋 Hi, I’m @cromylf
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, ai, mathematics and data science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science. I have an ancient MSc in Computer Science and experience as a developer and then on to management.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with some python coding, since I am relatively new to this and wish to practice. I enjoy programming, currently a hobby.
- 📫 You can reach me at cromylf@yahoo.com
